# Analysis Report
## Data collection:

There were two primary data sources used to collect data for our analysis, including:
 * [Stock News API](https://stocknewsapi.com/); and 
 * [Alpaca API](https://app.alpaca.markets/brokerage/new-account/overview)

 API calls were made to each of the data sources, to create a dynamic method of capturing and presenting data back to the individual via Streamlit (Python dashboard application).
